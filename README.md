## 🌋 What Is Primordyx?

Primordyx is a no-nonsense, PHP framework built around a familiar MVC structure. It’s 
ideal for developers who:

* Prefer readable code over clever tricks
* Enjoy setting things up their own way
* Want to avoid bloated frameworks with layers of magic
* Like having full control, from routing to rendering

## ⚙️ Features
* ⚡ Lightweight and fast—minimal overhead, maximum control
* 🗂️ Simple routing system
* 🔧 Flexible MVC conventions (without the rigidity)
* 🧱 Clean autoloading for controllers, models, and helper classes
* 🔐 Built-in Auth with role-based access and brute-force protection
* 🧪 Easy to debug, extend, and actually understand

## 🤠 Philosophy

Primordyx doesn’t tell you how to build — it gives you the ground to build on.

This isn’t a framework for everyone. It’s for developers who want structure 
without friction and freedom without chaos. If you like frameworks that 
bootload half the universe before rendering “Hello, World” — this 
probably isn’t for you.
