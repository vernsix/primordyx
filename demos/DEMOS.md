# Demo Code Notice

## ðŸš¨ Important: About These Demos

**Please set your expectations accordingly!** The demo code in this folder is primarily **AI-generated** and may not represent best practices or optimal implementation patterns for Primordyx applications.

### Current State of Demos

- **AI-Generated**: Most examples were created by AI to provide basic functionality demonstrations
- **Not Production-Ready**: These demos are for learning concepts, not for copying into real applications
- **Limited Real-World Testing**: The code may contain issues or suboptimal approaches

### Better Learning Resources

**For real-world implementation patterns, please refer to:**

- **Starter Application**: This is your best reference for understanding how Primordyx actually works
- **Framework Documentation**: Comprehensive API docs within the codebase
- **Core Framework Code**: The framework itself demonstrates proper patterns and architecture

### What to Expect Here

The demos in this folder will show you:
- Basic concept illustrations
- Simple feature demonstrations
- Quick proof-of-concept code

**But remember**: These are starting points for exploration, not examples of production code.

### Contributing Better Examples

I am actively working to replace AI-generated demos with real-world examples. If you create something useful with Primordyx, I'd love to include better examples that show proper implementation patterns!  I will be adding more examples soon.

---

**Bottom Line**: Use these demos to understand concepts, then look to the starter application for proper implementation guidance.
